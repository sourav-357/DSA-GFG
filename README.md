# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java - GFG Self-Paced 🚀

Welcome to my DSA-GFG repository!  
This repository contains my complete learning journey of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in **Java**.  
It follows the structure and syllabus of the **"GFG DSA Self-Paced Course"**, designed to strengthen core programming and problem-solving skills.

## 🧠 What This Repository Contains

- Implementations of all major data structures
- Step-by-step problem-solving with Java
- Solved problems from GFG practice sets and quizzes
- Detailed modular folders based on DSA topics
- Easy to navigate and run each problem individually
